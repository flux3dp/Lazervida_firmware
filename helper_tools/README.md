Put the built Lazervida_Bootloader.bin and Lazervida.bin in the same folder as the script and run it. It will create a file called "Lazervida_complete_fw.bin" which you can flash to the device.

NOTE: The firmware.bin to be dragged and dropped into the USB storage for the bootloader to flash is actually renamed from the built "Lazervida.hex" file instead of the .bin file
